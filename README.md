# 3d-printing
Collection of models I've 3D printed.

This repo is a mix of designs made by myself and designs downloaded from elsewhere (most notably, [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/)).
For content created by others, the LICENSE files in the respective subdirectories detail their copyright.

gcode files are mostly for my own consumption as you'll probably have re-slice the STL files in the CAD/ folder to match your printer and filament.

gcode files starting with `set` contain multiple models for easy/faster printing.
