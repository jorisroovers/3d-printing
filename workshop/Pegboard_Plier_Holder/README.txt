# Summary

I wanted a pegboard hanger for my pliers that laid them out towards me, to conserve space, but I couldn't find that anyone had designed one. Loglow's hooks had the best fit in my pegboard, so I used them as a starting point. Each module will hold 2-3 large pliers, or 5 or so little ones. Print it in its final orientation, with  support everywhere. 

I figured out why there was a scale import issue - unit mismatch between fusion360 and Repetier. You must make sure you are importing in mm for the scale to be correct.

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: Prusa
Printer: Prusa Clone
Rafts: No
Supports: Yes
Resolution: 0.2 mm
Infill: 75% or more

Notes: 
This requires a good amount of infill to prevent the top hooks from being too fragile.

# Post-Printing

Some filing may be required post-print for the pegs to fit without snagging, depending on your print quality.
