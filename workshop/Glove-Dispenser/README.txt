# Summary

I designed this Harbor Freight Nitrile Glove Dispenser so I could free up a bit more valuable workspace from my desktop, and still have readily available. In order to decrease print time, I cutaway the side walls and used angles less than 45 degrees so that support material wouldn't need to be generated.
While my pics display "Daboo" on the front, which is my nickname, I've removed it from the uploaded file here.

# Print Settings

Printer: Cetus Extended
Rafts: Yes
Supports: No
Resolution: .36
Infill: 15%

Notes: 
I printed this in fast mode at a .36 layer height so that it would print in ~3hrs. Being a tool that is only holding a box of gloves, this provides enough strength and while the finish isn't perfect at this speed, it looks fine and functions perfectly.
